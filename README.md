# Simple Information Language

A data notation language to be composed and parsed directly to/from your datatypes.  It's designed to be easily read by both humans and computers, structured by indentation.

# Roadmap

- Add helper procedures for appending or removing from serialized arrays or maps without parsing the whole file
- Add support for `using` structs within structs
